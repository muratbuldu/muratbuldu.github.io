	<h1>IVIS18 Project 2: Visualizing the World Through its Own Worldview</h1>
	<p>Learning</p>
	<p>Before this course, I had no experience about the visualization and the user experience. In addition to the experience, I have fun with the building these graphics and using D3.js. In this project, surprisingly I had lots of struggle with the preparation of the data, especially from the World Values Survey. Because their tool is really slow and the data have lots of gaps in the dataset, therefore choosing the questions and counteries became really hard and took so much time than the time I expected.</p>
